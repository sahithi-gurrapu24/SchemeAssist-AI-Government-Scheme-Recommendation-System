# SchemeAssist-AI-Government-Scheme-Recommendation-System

Project ID: AID105

Project Domain: Artificial Intelligence (AI/ML) / Data Science

Internship Program: CivoraX Internship Program  

**Project Overview**
SchemeAssist AI is an intelligent government scheme recommendation system designed to help citizens identify the most relevant welfare schemes based on their personal profile and eligibility criteria.
The system uses AI-driven analysis to match user demographics, income, location, and needs with central, state, and local government schemes. It provides clear eligibility insights, scheme prioritization, and actionable guidance for application.
This project focuses on practical AI usage, explainable decision-making, and citizen-friendly outputs rather than static information display.
